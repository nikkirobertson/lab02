# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object, Objects have states and behaviors.  An object is an instance of a class.
* class, A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.
* instance,
* method, Method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation
* signature, A signature is the method name and the number and type of its parameters
* parameter, Parameters are the variables that are listed as part of a method declaration. Each parameter must have a unique              name and a defined data type.
* type,
* state, Is defined by the attributes of the object and by the values these have.
* source code, Any collection of computer instructions, (possibly with comments), written using a human-readable computer                   language, usually as ordinary text.
* return value, Defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a subroutine or method
* compiler, A computer program that translates a program written in a high-level language into another language, usually machine language.

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html  
byte
short
long
float
double
char
boolean	
## What are the types of the following values?

* 0, int
* "hello", string
* 101
* -1
* true, boolean
* "33" , char
* 3.1415

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
